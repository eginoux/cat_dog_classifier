# Cat and Dog Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing a Cat and Dog Recognition project implemented using the TensorFlow library and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of building and training a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Introduction
This project is a part of the FreeCodeCamp challenges from the [Machine Learning with Python course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of deep learning models widely used for image classification tasks.
In this project, we utilize TensorFlow, a popular open-source deep learning framework, to build a CNN model that can accurately classify images of cats and dogs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset has been preprocessed and organized into training and validation sets. 
We use the flow from directory technique to extract data and preprocess it directly from the folder. 

## Model
We use a CNN architecture for binary classification of cat and dog images. 
The architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, max pooling layers for spatial reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. 
The model is trained to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss using the Adam optimizer and the accuracy metric. 

## Results
After training the CNN model on the dataset, we achieve impressive accuracy on classifying cat and dog images. The model's performance is showcased in the notebook, including metrics such as accuracy, loss, and visualizations of sample predictions.
